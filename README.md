## 💡 How This Differs from General AI Agent Lists

This list focuses specifically on **automating the scientific research process** — not general-purpose AI agents. We include projects that target one or more stages of the research lifecycle:

```
📖 Literature Review → 💡 Idea Generation → 🔍 Novelty Check → 📐 Experiment Design →
💻 Code Implementation → 🚀 Experiment Execution → 📊 Result Analysis → ✍️ Paper Writing → 📝 Peer Review
```

General-purpose coding agents (OpenHands, Aider, SWE-agent) are included because they serve as critical infrastructure for the experiment execution stage.

---

## 🤝 Contributing

PRs welcome! Please ensure the project:
- Has **500+ GitHub stars** (or is exceptionally notable with a top-venue publication)
- Is directly related to automating scientific research
- Is open-source with an active repository

Please keep entries sorted by star count (descending) within each category.
